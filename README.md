# Towards Explainable Creativity: Tackling the Remote Association Test with Knowledge Graphs
Remote Association Test (RAT) is a creativity test that assesses participants' creativity by measuring their associative ability. Various AI frameworks can perform computational creativity tests like the Remote Association Test to measure AI systems' cognitive and problem-solving abilities. However, the state-of-art, CreaCogs cannot propose explanations for these solutions. Thus, my master's thesis's proposed aim is to implement an AI system that can solve RAT computationally by acquiring knowledge from a common-sense knowledge base and word embeddings and constructing explanations for these RAT solutions. The proposed approaches are implemented and evaluated with the state-of-art and the normative data of Bowden and Jung (2013). The study concludes that knowledge from ConceptNet provides a plausible approach to solve RAT computationally and explain "why" an answer is related to the RAT query.
